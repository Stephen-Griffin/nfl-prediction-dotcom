'For our project, we decided to make a model that uses a combination of pre and in-game features to predict the outcome of NFL matchups. Essentially, we are trying to determine which team will win a football game as it is unfolding, not just beforehand. By identifying which pieces of data are most influential during the game, our model can highlight trends or key performance indicators that matter the most. This insight could help players, coaches, or analysts make more informed decisions in real time and better understand how specific events impact the final result.';
